<!-- The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there. -->

<!-- The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/. -->

<!-- Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. -->

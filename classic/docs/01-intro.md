# Homely Recipes Documentation

Step-by-step guides to set up and use Homely Recipes to get your website up and running.

## Getting Started

<!-- Get started by **creating a new site**. -->

[Click on this demo](https://homelyrecipes.netlify.app) and see what you'll build and get right away.

### What you'll need

- Github Account
- Netlify Account for free hosting
  - Netlify CMS (optional)
- Domain Name (optional)
- Eleventy (coming soon...)

> For accessing CMS or Content Management System, you'll have to type `/admin` at the end of your deployed site. For example: `https://homelyrecipes.netlify.app/admin`.

> **Note**: The `/admin` access will **only be available** after you deploy your _own_ site and **add** a CMS like NetlifyCMS.
> Can't wait to see how it works? [Check out the tutorial here](/docs/managing-content/cms/) to learn how to add a CMS to simplify your process of adding content.

<!-- Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. -->

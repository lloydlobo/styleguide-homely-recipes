Semantics is a term used in programming to describe the meaning of a piece of code.

The following examples show the context between purpose and appearance:

1. "How does that line of JavaScript have an effect when run?"
2. "What is the purpose or function of that HTML element?"

We question, "What is its purpose?" rather than "What does it look like?"
